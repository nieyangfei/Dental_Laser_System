# Dental_Laser_System
Developed a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control method for a CO2 laser, sourced components, and collaborated with a mechanical technician on system integration. Conducted experiments on artificial and real teeth to evaluate laser performance and treatment outcomes. Developed Modbus-RTU communication software to exchange monitoring and control data—such as laser intensity, pulse duration, and operating modes—with the control system.
